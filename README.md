# 🏡 House Pricing Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Machine Learning model** that predicts house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of rooms, location, and other relevant attributes. The dataset used for this project was sourced from **Kaggle**.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Housing Dataset]
- **Target Variable:** House Price

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**
  - Pandas 🐼
  - NumPy 🔢
  - Matplotlib 📊
  - Seaborn 📈
  - Scikit-Learn 🤖
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch (Optional for Deep Learning)

## 🛠️ Steps Followed
1. **Data Collection** – Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaned missing values, handled outliers, and transformed categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualized trends and relationships in the dataset.
4. **Feature Engineering** – Created new features and removed irrelevant ones.
5. **Model Selection & Training** – Trained models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
6. **Model Evaluation** – Used RMSE, R², and other metrics to assess model performance.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Improved accuracy with GridSearchCV.

## 📈 Results & Performance
- Best performing model: **Random Forest Regressor**
- Achieved **XX% accuracy** with an RMSE of **XX.X**.

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Try Deep Learning models like ANN.
- Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit.
- Improve feature selection with advanced techniques.
